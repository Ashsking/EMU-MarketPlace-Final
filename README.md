# 📦 EMU Student Marketplace – Final Project

A full-stack Flask web application designed for the Eastern Mennonite University (EMU) community.  
This platform enables student-to-student selling, official EMU store purchasing, secure account management, and personalized dashboards — all built using Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and HTML/CSS.

---

## 🚀 Overview

The EMU Student Marketplace is a centralized platform where EMU students can buy, sell, and browse items in a safe, EMU-exclusive environment. The platform supports two main item categories:

- **Student Marketplace Listings** – students create and manage their own listings  
- **Official EMU Store Listings** – the EMU store can post items for direct purchase  

The application includes authentication, image upload support, item posting/editing, secure order handling, and a student dashboard showing purchases, sales, and listings.
